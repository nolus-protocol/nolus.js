/**
 * The Liquidity Provider Pool (LPP) is a smart contract responsible for managing lending and borrowing activity within a specific currency on the Nolus Protocol.
 * Key characteristics:
 * - One LPP instance per currency (e.g. USDC, ATOM), handling both deposits and borrow requests in that asset.
 * - Accepts single-sided deposits from users (no LP token pairing required).
 * - Issues loans for opening margin positions via the Leaser module.
 * - Accumulates interest from borrowers and periodically receives rewards from the Treasury contract.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { NolusClient, NolusContracts } from '@nolus/nolusjs';
 *
 * const cosm = await NolusClient.getInstance().getCosmWasmClient();
 * lppInstance = new NolusContracts.Lpp(cosm, lppContractAddress);
 * ```
 *
 * There are also methods for simulating contract operations in order to obtain preliminary information about the transaction.
